## Inception

The Reasons because of which the app was created in the first place.

- Fed up of the last Password Manager I was using due it's irregularities in platform sync.
- Wanted to create a self made solution to that.
- Was working on Development and wanted to work on something not so usual.
- Wanted to test my skill in Flutter Development.
